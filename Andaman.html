     <p class="Description" id="ul" style="margin-left: 125px">
It is a group of about 300 islands deep in the Bay of Bengal. Though only a few islands have population. The land surface is hilly and rocky and is covered with rain forests.
 Before independence these islands were known as <b>Kalapani</b>. Freedom fighters and life prisoners were sent to the Cellular Jail here. The prisoners had to live here under very harsh conditions. The present inhabitants of Andaman are mostly the descendants of these life prisoners. They are from all parts of India and speak different Indian languages. You’ll be shocked by how good they can speak English & Hindi even after being in the South-Eastern India. <a href="images/home_gallery/map.jpg">(Map)</a>
Rubber, coconut, tobacco, and coffee are grown in abundance. Fruits like lemon, orange, banana, mango and pineapple are also grown here.

<li><b>Places to visit </b><br><br>
Most of the travelers who visit Andaman Islands, visit:
</li><br>
<ul>
  <li><i>Port Blair</i> (The Capital of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Port Blair is connected with Chennai and Calcutta by air and sea routes), </li><br>
  <li><i>Jolly Buoy</i> island(known for its live underwater corals and the pristine clear beach),</li><br>
  <li><i> North Bay </i>island (for water activities),</li><br>
  <li><i>Neil Island </i>(Scenic Island with very little crowd and lots of open space)</li><br>
  Now, those who come for longer duration visit Middle Andaman, this includes Baratang Island and North Andaman, known for its turtle nesting grounds and twin island Ross and Smith. 
</ul><br>
<li> <b>Timing:</b><br><br>The climate of Andaman and Nicobar Islands is warm and humid. It gets rain almost throughout the year. (So keep an umbrella with you always).
All the beaches are open from 9 AM to 5 PM, except the Jolly Buoy island beach which gets closed by 2:30 PM.
Though islands like Jolly Buoy & Red Skin are opened for 6 months alternatively in a year to protect live corals.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>Cusines: <br><br></b>Seafood is the main cuisine of Andamanese. So Andaman is the paradise for Sea Food lovers. Lobsters, Crab, Prawns, Cuttlefish, & fish of every kind is found here.  
But there are plenty of other options also available for Vegetarians.
</li> 
<br>
<li><b>Activities</b></li><br>
<ul>
    <li><i>Scuba Diving at Havelock Island/North Bay Island </i>- Courses for both Swimmers and Non Swimmers are available. After successful underwater experience participants will be given a certificate and video of their underwater trip.</li><br>
    <li><i>Sea Walk at North Bay Island </i>- Both Swimmers and Non Swimmers can avail this trip. </li><br>
    <li><i>Snorkeling at Jolly Buoy</i> - Anyone over the age of 7 Years can avail this activity. (Highlight – You get to touch live corals)</li><br>
    <li><i>Trekking to Limestone Caves</i> – “Baratang Island” – People who enjoy digging into past and natural formations would love limestone caves at Baratang Island. A little tiring for elderly people and people with physical disabilities.</li><br>
</ul>
<li><b>Budget:</b> <br><br>Some packages can go less than 5000 per person. Yes, off course this is the starting range where people travel for only 3 Nights or less to Andaman Islands
But 3 nights will not be sufficient for you, our personal suggestion is to take any package of about 10 nights, that may cost up to 12000 per person but that’ll totally worth your money.
